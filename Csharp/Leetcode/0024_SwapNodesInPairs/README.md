# [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs)

## Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Example:

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

Note:

1. Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
2. You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Solution

Simply swap every two nodes and jump to the next pair. The time complexity is O(n) and constant space is used.
