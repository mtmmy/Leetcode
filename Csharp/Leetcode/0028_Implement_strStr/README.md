# [28. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr)

## Description

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
