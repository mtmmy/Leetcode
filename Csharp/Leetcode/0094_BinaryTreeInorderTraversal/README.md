# [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal)

## Description

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
