# [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
Example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.
