# [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted)

## Description

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
Note:
Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```
