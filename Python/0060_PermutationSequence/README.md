# [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence)

## Description

The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:

- Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
