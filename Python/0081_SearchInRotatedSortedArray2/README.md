# [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii)

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```
