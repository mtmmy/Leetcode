# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways)

## Description

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:

```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

## Solution

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. First, we create a array **dp** where **dp[i]** denotes the number of combinations can be generated by **s[0:i]**.

We set the default value of dp[0] as 1 and then we start the loop. We update dp[i] with the value of dp[i-1] if s[i-1] is not zero because under this situation, combinations of s[0:i] is at least as much as s[0:i-1]. Otherwise, dp[i] = 0 because 0 cannot be converted to any character.

The checking mentioned above only considers 'A' to 'I' where the corresponding numbers are 1 ~ 9. We need to put other characters into consideration. So when the numbers can be seen as between 10 to 26, we take the combinations of dp[i - 2] and add it up to dp[i]. This implys we consider s[i-2:i] as a number.

The time complexity and auxiliary space are both O(N).
