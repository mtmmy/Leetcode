# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)

## Description

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
