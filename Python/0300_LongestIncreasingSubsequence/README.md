# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence)

## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

Note:

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
