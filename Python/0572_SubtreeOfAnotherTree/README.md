# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree)

## Description

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:
Given tree s:

```
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
```

```
   4 
  / \
 1   2
```

Example 2:
Given tree s:

```
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
```

```
   4
  / \
 1   2
```
