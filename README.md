|2|[Add Two Numbers](https://github.com/mtmmy/Leetcode/blob/master/Csharp/Leetcode/0002_AddTwoNumbers)|C#|[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers)\n\n## Description\n\nYou are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\nExample\n```\nInput: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)|

|8|[String to Integer (atoi)](https://github.com/mtmmy/Leetcode/blob/master/Csharp/Leetcode/0008_StringToInteger)|C#|[Leetcode](atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi)\n\n## Description\n\nImplement atoi which converts a string to an integer.\nThe function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.\nThe string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.\nIf the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.\nIf no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.\nNote:\nExample 1:\n```\nInput: "42"\nOutput: 42\n```\nExample 2:\n```\nInput: "   -42"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation: The first non-whitespace character is \'-\', which is the minus sign.\n             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.\n```\nExample 3:\n```\nInput: "4193 with words"\nOutput: 4193\nExplanation: Conversion stops at digit \'3\' as the next character is not a numerical digit.\n```\nExample 4:\n```\nInput: "words and 987"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The first non-whitespace character is \'w\', which is not a numerical \n             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.\n```\nExample 5:\n```\nInput: "-91283472332"\nOutput: -2147483648\nExplanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.\n             Thefore INT_MIN (\xe2\x88\x92231)|
